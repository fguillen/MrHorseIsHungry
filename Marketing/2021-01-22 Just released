I just finished my last experimental game "MrHorse is Hungry", it is an extremely linear, no enemies, 5 minutes surrealist game.

I am very new in all this of game development, with this project I was trying to work with old-school hand-drawing animations.

I've just fallen in love with MrHorse and I may use it for another games :)

Suggestions, comments, bugs report are very welcome.
